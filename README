This program enables storing documentation projects in one place and share files
between projects easily.

The documentation is available in the RST (reStructuredText) format under
*./doc/source* of this project.

The sources are found under the *src* directory. The program is written in
Python. For more details about the implementation, see the documentation in the
source code the documentation.

The *org* directory contains the *backlog* (*./org/backlog.org*), *journal*
(*./org/journal.org*) and *history* (*./org/history.org*). These are *org-mode*
files. It is recommended that you use the *emacs* text editor in order to
benefit from this environment.

The *backlog* collects user stories that have not been implemented yet. The
*journal* contains the user stories that are the focus of the current
sprint. The *history* contains the implemented user stories.

The *tests* directory contains tests in the doctest format. The names of files
are the abbreviations created based on user stories. These tests are executable
from the *journal*.
